<h3 id="aboutMeTitle">About Me ...</h3>
<p id="aboutMeIntro">Hello! My name is Shivam Mehta. Thank you for visiting my website. I hope you have a great 2026. I recently turned 30 years old. A huge milestone for me. Recently, I have been focusing on internal self-improvement and retrospection. My hobbies include traveling, sports, music, video games, and asking AI questions.
I traveled to many countries. I look forward to making more trips. Sports, to me, are the greatest story ever. Hip-hop is my most convenient outlet, so I listen a lot. AI is important, and it will be the greatest check for humans. The future is incredible, and more connections will be made. Working towards something is
very important to me as well. I have held many jobs, and each one presented opportunities to learn. With new doors come new openings. Thank you again for being here! </p>

Thank you to them.
As for my profession, I am still looking to continue my career in Software Development. With the help of this website and many projects I look to complete, I would like to return to the workforce in which I specialized. Deadlines and active communication are some of my greatest strengths. Constantly being there for my team members and
asking questions are my redeeming qualities. Of these four qualities, I am capable of great tasks while guiding and communicating. I look forward to working with you in the future. </p>

<p>Dots… Let’s Connect was an interactive contact-sharing application built using QR code and NFC technologies. I worked on this project for over three years, continuously maintaining the codebase while improving the tech stack and feature set. The app was developed using React Native, TypeScript, Firebase, and Expo Go, with an emphasis on simplicity and clean design. As development progressed and additional features were introduced, the project grew increasingly complex. Although the app was deployed to the Apple App Store, it was ultimately rejected due to stability issues that caused crashes, which brought the project to an end. Despite this outcome, the experience provided valuable lessons in long-term project ownership, scalability, and deployment challenges.

Throughout college, I completed a wide range of projects, from individual homework assignments to large collaborative group efforts. These included a note-taking application, a recreation of the game Flappy Bird, small laboratory exercises, a gaming project, multiple website builds, and a school charting system for tracking curricula and assignments. Many of these projects were technically challenging, yet highly engaging and rewarding to complete.

Building a personal website has become a way for me to revisit these experiences while continuing to refine and expand my technical skills. This website serves not only as a portfolio of my work, but also as a tool for self-reflection and growth as a developer. I have earned introductory certifications in GitHub usage and version control, and I am actively developing my web development skills through IBM’s free online courses.

Beyond software, I enjoy hands-on work both indoors and outdoors. I have experience with 3D printing and visualization tools such as AutoCAD. Although my 3D printer’s heated bed was damaged during a build, the experience reinforced my interest in building, troubleshooting, and creating tangible solutions. At my core, I enjoy working with my hands just as much as I enjoy building through code. </p>

<p>University of Virginia, 2019, with a B.S. in Computer Science, minor in Engineering Business. College was a challenge for me because I had many questions regarding the materials I encountered along the way. A lot of these questions were answered. Now I look to AI to answer some of these questions. Some of my favorite classes are Science, Math, History, Chemistry, and Labs. I attended sporting events often. I studied a lot and also made many friends. The library became a place of peace and study for me, like many others. I took a lot of time researching and building myself. However, I went through hard times in the last two years at the University. I did my best to make the most out of my time there. WAHOOWA and Go HOOS!</p>
