<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Shivam Mehta. Thank you for visiting my website. I hope you have a great 2026. I recently turned 30 years old. A huge milestone for me. Recently, I have been focusing on internal self-improvement and retrospection. My hobbies include traveling, sports, music, video games, and asking AI questions.
I traveled to many countries. I look forward to making more trips. Sports, to me, are the greatest story ever. Hip-hop is my most convenient outlet, so I listen a lot. AI is important, and it will be the greatest check for humans. The future is incredible, and more connections will be made. Working towards something is
very important to me as well. I have held many jobs, and each one presented opportunities to learn. With new doors come new openings. Thank you again for being here! </p>
<h3>Work Experience</h3>
<p>I worked at a startup, a hotel, a large organization, a restaurant, in sales, etc. I contributed the best I could at each company. I am a hard worker with a great ability to learn fast. I have had great mentors and positive people around me. My mentors have always answered my questions and led me in the right direction. Thank you to them.
As for my profession, I am still looking to continue my career in Software Development. With the help of this website and many projects I look to complete, I would like to return to the workforce in which I specialized. Deadlines and active communication are some of my greatest strengths. Constantly being there for my team members and
asking questions are my redeeming qualities. Of these four qualities, I am capable of great tasks while guiding and communicating. I look forward to working with you in the future. </p>
<h3>College</h3>
<p>University of Virginia, 2019, with a B.S. in Computer Science, minor in Engineering Business. College was a challenge for me because I had many questions regarding the materials I encountered along the way. A lot of these questions were answered. Now I look to AI to answer some of these questions. Some of my favorite classes are Science, Math, History, Chemistry, and Labs. I attended sporting events often. I studied a lot and also made many friends. The library became a place of peace and study for me, like many others. I took a lot of time researching and building myself. However, I went through hard times in the last two years of University. I did my best to make the most out of my time there.</p>

<h3>Projects and Blog</h3>
<p>Dots...Let's Connect, an app with an interactive approach for contact sharing, leveraging QR Codes and NFC technologies. I worked on this app for 3 years, continually enhancing and improving the tech stack and maintaining code. I used Firebase, React Native, Typescript, and Expo Go. It was simple with a clear design. As more improvements came about, the project became too complex. I deployed on the App Store for Apple; however, it was rejected because it was crashing.
That ended the project. A personal website is a great way to start backtracking and improving my skills. This website serves to better understand skills as well as myself. I have small certifications in Github’s use and applications, as well as working on website development through IBM free courses. I love to 3D print as well as use visualization tools like AutoCAD. My 3D printer's hot bed, unfortunately, got destroyed after a build. Mainly, more than anything, I like to work with my hands, outdoors or indoors. </p>
